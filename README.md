# phpvms-acars
This is still in early development, expect issues! If you find issues, create a new issue [here.](https://github.com/ajh123/phpvms-acars/issues)

ACARS system for phpVMS, powered by PythonÂ®.

## Using a flight simulator

phpvms-acars will support any flight simulator (or Minecraft). To do this there will be an API which the flight simulator must communicate with. Some flight simulators may not work with the API "out of the box" so a mod / plugin / script must be used.
